# Scriptie

The programming part of my My Master's Thesis Computing Science which I finished in 2018. The SlimProject/src/glove folder and the SlimProject/src/org/jblas folder are algorithms implemented by someone else (will add reference later). I created everything in the SlimProject/src/getSourceCode and the SlimProject/src/parameterOptimization folder.

 ## Description of program
 For a more detailed explanation check my Thesis: https://www.academia.edu/40156186/Combining_Stochastic_Local_Search_with_Machine_Learning_for_Vehicle_Routing
 
 The goal of this program is to find a better solution to a specific instance of a Vehicle Routing Problem.
